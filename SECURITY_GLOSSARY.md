# Cybersecurity Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of cybersecurity terms, acronyms, and concepts. Curated by [AllSecurityNews.com](https://allsecuritynews.com)

## A

**Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** - A prolonged and targeted cyberattack in which an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period.

**Attack Surface** - The total sum of vulnerabilities, entry points, and assets that an attacker could exploit to gain unauthorized access.

**Authentication** - The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to resources.

**Authorization** - The process of determining what resources or actions an authenticated user is allowed to access or perform.

## B

**Blue Team** - The defensive security team responsible for protecting systems and detecting/responding to threats.

**Botnet** - A network of compromised computers (bots) controlled remotely by an attacker to perform malicious activities.

**Brute Force Attack** - An attack method that tries every possible combination of passwords or encryption keys until the correct one is found.

## C

**CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** - A standardized identifier for known security vulnerabilities maintained by MITRE Corporation.

**CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)** - A framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities on a scale from 0-10.

**Cryptography** - The practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted with the proper key.

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** - An attack that tricks a victim into submitting a malicious request using their authenticated session.

**CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)** - A community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types.

## D

**DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** - An attack that overwhelms a target system with traffic from multiple sources, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Data Exfiltration** - The unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network.

**Defense in Depth** - A security strategy that employs multiple layers of defense to protect against threats.

## E

**Encryption** - The process of encoding information so that only authorized parties can access it.

**Endpoint Security** - Security measures designed to protect end-user devices (computers, mobile devices) from cyber threats.

**Exploit** - Code or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability to compromise a system.

## F

**Firewall** - A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

**Forensics (Digital Forensics)** - The process of collecting, analyzing, and preserving electronic evidence for investigation purposes.

## H

**Hashing** - A one-way cryptographic function that converts data into a fixed-size string of characters.

**Honeypot** - A decoy system designed to attract attackers and study their methods without risking real assets.

## I

**IDS (Intrusion Detection System)** - A system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators.

**IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** - A system that monitors network traffic and can automatically block detected threats.

**Incident Response** - The process of identifying, investigating, and remediating security incidents.

## M

**Malware** - Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise computer systems.

**Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** - An attack where an attacker secretly intercepts and relays communications between two parties.

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** - An authentication method that requires two or more verification factors to gain access.

## P

**Patch** - A software update designed to fix vulnerabilities or improve functionality.

**Pen Testing (Penetration Testing)** - Authorized simulated attacks on computer systems to find security vulnerabilities.

**Phishing** - A social engineering attack that uses deceptive emails or messages to trick victims into revealing sensitive information.

**Privilege Escalation** - An attack that exploits vulnerabilities to gain elevated access rights on a system.

## R

**Ransomware** - Malware that encrypts victims files and demands payment for the decryption key.

**Red Team** - The offensive security team that simulates attacks to test an organizations defenses.

**Risk Assessment** - The process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating security risks to an organization.

## S

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** - A platform that collects and analyzes security event data from across an organization.

**Social Engineering** - Manipulation techniques used to trick people into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

**SQL Injection** - An attack that inserts malicious SQL code into application queries to manipulate databases.

**SSL/TLS** - Cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over networks.

## T

**Threat Actor** - An individual or group responsible for security incidents or attacks.

**Threat Intelligence** - Evidence-based knowledge about existing or emerging threats used to inform security decisions.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** - A security process requiring two different authentication factors (e.g., password + SMS code).

## V

**Vulnerability** - A weakness in a system that could be exploited to compromise security.

**VPN (Virtual Private Network)** - A secure, encrypted connection over a public network.

## W

**WAF (Web Application Firewall)** - A firewall specifically designed to protect web applications from attacks.

**Whitelisting** - A security practice of explicitly allowing only approved applications, users, or IP addresses.

## X

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** - An attack that injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

## Z

**Zero-Day** - A vulnerability that is exploited before the vendor releases a patch.

**Zero Trust** - A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources.
